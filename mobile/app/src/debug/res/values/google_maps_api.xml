    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using these values:

    Package name:
    A5:BF:F0:93:F9:24:22:4F:07:F9:A2:FE:00:34:D5:5F:29:41:FF:43

    SHA-1 certificate fingerprint:
    A5:BF:F0:93:F9:24:22:4F:07:F9:A2:FE:00:34:D5:5F:29:41:FF:43

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
